# Exception part III

- [ ] Most runtime exceptions come from your code logic
- [ ] You want runtime exceptions to happen at development aane testing phase
- [ ] A try/catch is for handling exceptions, not flaws in your code
- [ ] Instead of duplicating stuff put mandatory actions in finally block
- [ ] A method can throw more than one exception
