# habit 6: Synergize by treating others with openness and respect.

- [ ] You can leverage the power of synergy by being open with others and valuing these differences.
- [ ] The path to synergizing starts with seeing your interactions with others as an adventure.
- [ ] So make a list of the people you find it difficult to discuss things with and think about their views.
- [ ]  If you were more confident and open-minded, do you think you could find synergies between your perspective and theirs?
