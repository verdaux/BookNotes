# Writing

- [ ] Henry de Montherlant said - happiness writes in a white ink on a white page.
- [ ] Big story, big engine - story= engine.
- [ ] 6 questions -> 1.whose story? Through line?
- [ ] 2. What's the story? Ok if you don't know start to end.
- [ ] 3. Why are you telling that story?
- [ ] 4. When? Time which is most familiar
- [ ] 5. Where? Location -> can't get the wheels turning until you know what the ground is
- [ ] 6. How? Ulysses -> most crucial
- [ ] Write a letter to yourself as if you're talking to a friend.
- [ ] Flesh out a story structure -> skeleton -> plot -> find out if you need to know before hand.
- [ ] Allow your story to unfold.
- [ ] Refer -> French new wave -> Italian new wave -> Visconti , Truffaut, Goddard no 3 act structure.
- [ ] Book can be a single moment.
- [ ] Sometimes, you don't start at the beginning. Flashback is very common. It can be fluid.
- [ ] It can't be random. One thing after another is incomprehensible.
- [ ] Who is doing what to whom?
- [ ] How the Characters' destinies are connected to each other? Different depending on the scale of the character.
- [ ] For example, in a multi generational novel- Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks. Book should have a strong cohesion. Characters are integrated and interlocked.
- [ ] Mirroring - reader sees and connects. Shouldn't be artificial. Should not be same.
- [ ] Embrace false starts -> trial and error. Many attempts at finding the door that leads you to a story.
- [ ] Talk to and investigate, interrogate yourself. End product is different.
