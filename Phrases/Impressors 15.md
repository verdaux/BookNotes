- [ ] criticism of any art or media is treated as an assault on the people who like that art and media
- [ ] Your skin makes me feel forgiven
- [ ] If you like this, then you like me.
- [ ] Hello? Do I have to do all the work?
- [ ] If you were a bullet, I'd shoot myself to have you in me.
- [ ] You make overthinking look cute
- [ ] Do you not know your line?
- [ ] Never buy weed from a cat
- [ ] I’m learning to stop shrinking myself to fit spaces that were never meant to hold me.
