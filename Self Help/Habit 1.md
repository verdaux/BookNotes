# Habit 1

- [ ] The first habit: Be proactive and take control of your own fate.
- [ ] The outer circle is your Circle of Concern, representing all the things youâ€™re concerned about, ranging from the electricity bill to the threat of nuclear war.
- [ ] Inside this circle is the smaller Circle of Influence, which represents all the things you can actually do something about.
- [ ] Proactive people focus on their Circles of Influence, choosing to work on the things within their control.
- [ ] Whether at home or at work, whenever you catch yourself blaming someone or something external for a problem you face, remind yourself that the root cause is your reaction to the problem.
