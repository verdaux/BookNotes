# Assertive

- [ ] You go ... With your eyes. And I interpret that to mean you are not with us in some way.
- [ ] Have you noticed how you....?
- [ ] I don't like it when you do....
- [ ] I'm gonna come back when you're in a calmer mood
- [ ] You are shouting at me. Are you sure this is the best way to resolve this problem?
- [ ] You are correct that this situation could've been handled better. But, calling it stupid is too harsh.
