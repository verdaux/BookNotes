# Exception part IV

- [ ] Exceptions are objects
- [ ] Just because you have one all purpose polymorphic catch, doesn't always mean you should
- [ ] Multiple catch block must be ordered from smallest to biggest
- [ ] Siblings can be in any order because they can't catch one another's exception
- [ ] If you don't wanna handle an exception, you can duck it by declaring it
