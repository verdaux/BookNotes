# Variable comparison

- [ ] == operator is used ONLY to compare bits in 2 variables
- [ ] Use == to compare primitives
- [ ] Use equals() method to check if 2 different objects are equal. For eg strings are "abcd"
- [ ] Use == if 2 reference variables refer to the same object on the heap
- [ ] Object a = new Object (); Object b = new object (); Object c= a; 
- [ ] a == b // false
- [ ] a == c // true
