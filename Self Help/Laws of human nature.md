# Laws of human nature

- [ ] increase your reaction time so that you’re not making decisions in the heat of an emotional moment
- [ ] consider all the possible biases influencing the decision.
- [ ] confirmation bias, where we tend to seek out information that supports our prejudices
- [ ] appearance bias, which leads us to believe that someone who looks appealing, whether it’s attractive or rich, must somehow be of good character.
