- [ ] Flattery succeeds best on minds previously occupied by conceit. ~ Norm MacDonald.
- [ ] I'm curious why you think that.
- [ ] It's crowded, it's chaotic but it's alive. And it's waiting for you.
- [ ] Engineering the narrative is a fancy way of saying you lied.
- [ ] You can open your fist because you can't punch the wind.
- [ ] Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.
- [ ] Sometimes, emotions shout louder than logic.
- [ ] Past behaviour is the best predictor for future performance.
- [ ] When all the facts fall short of believability, fantasy feels reassuringly solid.
- [ ] Whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.
