# Impressors 7

- [ ] Exhaust my mental arsenal of escape routes
- [ ] Loophole-abusing monster
- [ ] Fight through self-centred haze
- [ ] It might be a problem, we don't know yet
- [ ] What kind of browken monster hates music?
- [ ] Smash my dick with a hammer
- [ ] [when someone calls you ugly]... and you're stupid. Don't we make a pair? Frankly, I'd be ugly rather than stupid.
- [ ] New guy? I don't respect that smell.
- [ ] I broke a grown man that day.
- [ ] What a tough way to go through life.
- [ ] Name a neurological disease after me when I die
- [ ] Born at the time of Crosshairs of internet and puberty
- [ ] You have lost nothing in your sexiness by being so elegant
- [ ] I don't wanna be dancing in front of all these witnesses
- [ ] It's free. And that's the most important thing for me. Because I'm broke.
- [ ] I wish I had bought the Microsoft stock in the 80s. The only problem is I wasn't born yet.
