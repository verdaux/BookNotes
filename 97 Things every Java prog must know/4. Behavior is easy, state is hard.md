# 4. Behavior is easy, state is hard

- [ ] Encapsulation allows us to tame the growing state and complexity of the code.
- [ ] Setters can cause inconsistent states
- [ ] Immutability of class is the answer
- [ ] But we must minimize mutability.
- [ ] Have properly coded factory methods and builders
- [ ] don't generate setters automatically
- [ ] use anti-corruption layer to protect and validate internal state after setters set
