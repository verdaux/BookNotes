- [ ] You represent everything I hate but I do find you highly amusing. Please continue.
- [ ] If I were kidding, I'd be dressed like you.

- [ ] I don't trust him, he has no nasal hair
- [ ] When I say different I mean wrong

- [ ] Do you think that suggestion really deserved that preface....
- [ ] There may have been an item A and an item B. And I may have introduced them to once another.
- [ ] There he is. Half iago. Half fu man chu. All bastard.
