# Assertive

- [ ] You go ... With your eyes. And I interpret that to mean you are not with us in some way.
- [ ] Have you noticed how you....?
- [ ] If they deny their behaviour: Say " I may be wrong but Is it okay to point out this behaviour the next time you repeat it?"
- [ ] I don't like it when you do....
- [ ] I'm gonna come back when you're in a calmer mood
- [ ] You are shouting at me. Are you sure this is the best way to resolve this problem?
- [ ] You are correct that this situation could've been handled better. But, calling it stupid is too harsh.
- [ ] I'm really bad at coping with being interrupted.
- [ ] I am not going to justify why I feel a certain way.
- [ ] I am an okay person.
- [ ] I understand but....
- [ ] I know it's difficult but ...
- [ ] I know it's not your fault that this happened....
- [ ] Fogging - in case of a verbal attack - You are entitled to your opinion - You might be right - it's like a shrug - Don't react and give them a fight back - there is always room for improvement - fogging is only the start.
- [ ] Overall are you happy?
- [ ] I'm afraid I have to decline.
- [ ] I'd hate to commit and do it poorly.  So I better don't.
- [ ] Do you think you are responding in the most mature manner?
