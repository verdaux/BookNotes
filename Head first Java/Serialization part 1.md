# Serialization part 1

- [ ] Objects have state and behaviour
- [ ] Objects can be flattened and inflated
- [ ] Behavior lives within class, but state lives within each object
- [ ] If your data will be used only by the Java program, use serialization
- [ ] Data moves in streams from one place to another
