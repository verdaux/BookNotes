# Impressors

- [ ] This looks like a hostage situation. Blink if you are in trouble.
- [ ] Posses not one jot of talent.
- [ ] Let's explore the stars
- [ ] Mysteries of the skin
- [ ] A face difficult to turn away from, a face to dream about
- [ ] Turn your tongue into a weapon of cruelty
- [ ] Indispensable other that dwelled in my skin
- [ ] Each one an inseparable half of a single, two-part human organism
- [ ] A chance to spend a few moments in the ephemeral kingdom of earthly grace.
- [ ] Missed a thing in the way a smoker misses cigarettes
- [ ] The best thing about being 21 is that you don't have to be 21 for more than a year.
- [ ] A man who had suffered and could still crack jokes.
- [ ] There's a violent curse against each and every one who has done me wrong
- [ ] The Queen of all earth and every city in heaven.
- [ ] It's my duty to please that booty
- [ ] I don't wanna be crude. Well, I do wanna be crude. But not untill later on. I'll ease it in.
- [ ] That is nothing more than a happy coincidence
- [ ] I'm in all kinds of trouble
- [ ] It's clearly a mixed ability group
- [ ] The president declared a national emergency because of all the stolen hearts
- [ ] If you're not laughing you're learning and that's great too
- [ ] Walking, talking, stephen Hawking
- [ ] I can smell that with my eyes
- [ ] Cheese is now coursing through my veins. I'm on borrowed time.
- [ ] I'm doing the " I have to shit myself box step"
- [ ] But sooner or later I'm going to blame myself. But not today.
- [ ] My skin learned at a very young age that it couldn't rely on me.
- [ ] I finally know what I want. And that in itself is a miracle. I want you.
- [ ] I don't necessarily agree with you but I appreciate it
- [ ] All my options are still options
- [ ] Allah ka karam hai, Biryani Garam hai
- [ ] Stir me to my depths
- [ ] These discussions between my brain and my heart which went on without my knowledge may have been terrible
- [ ] Everything else must take second place
- [ ] It's the most complete, most painful magic. You are here, as much as I and more intensely; wherever I am you're there as much as I am, and indeed more so.
- [ ] I don't know what that means but I'm in
- [ ] There's a certain level of accountability with permanence
- [ ] That's a moment of my life I'll never get back.
- [ ] I've never seen a human being question himself so many times in a split second.

- [ ] Take your broken wings and fly away
- [ ] They hired and fired you. They were wrong twice.
- [ ] I won. By like a landslide
- [ ] I don't do drugs because it's too tedious. Everything becomes routine. You just stay there for 9 hours going aaaargh. Then you run out of aaarrgh. Then you buy more drugs. It's an endless cycle of repitition. I don't get it.
- [ ] Comedy is a lot like sex if they haven't made a noise change what you're doing
- [ ] You have the right to remain sexy
- [ ] I know songs that will melt your face.
- [ ] Look at her. She's got goodness running out of her ear.
