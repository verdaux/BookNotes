- [ ] Life is too short to be in love with everyone you meet.
- [ ] When I raise my eyes to your face, then a fire breaks out and I see nothing but fire.
- [ ] Another reason why a self-respecting man should ever wear torn jeans.
- [ ] I'm a once-in-a-generation writer. The writer to end all writers, you know?
- [ ] Can't disrespect kings and queens like that. Thinking of them ever since
- [ ] Always wanted to be photographed as such
- [ ] The simultaneous pride and pain I felt.
- [ ] If that's your interpretation, I welcome it.
- [ ] Secretly bend the laws of the universe
- [ ] You just figured out you're mortal. Just a bag of cells and waste with an expiration date.
- [ ] Hahaha. Shut up. This is the best.
- [ ] Staunch supporter of the counterculture of the analog art.
- [ ] Ughh. It's so luscious
- [ ] No one should have to go through this
- [ ] Women with bangs are braver
- [ ] Don't tell the others but you're my favourite
- [ ] A normal sized artwork next to a homunculus
- [ ] Not every soul knows how to hold joy with gentle hands
- [ ] I'm dancing with penury
- [ ] I'm not entirely myself
- [ ] I fear I must forego the pleasure
- [ ] I find my every thought returning to you
- [ ] I hold you in the highest affection
- [ ] 28 is a great age to trot around in a burberry trench
- [ ] It feels like there's something on your mind
- [ ] What's been the best part of your week so far?
- [ ] Spoken like a true relic
- [ ] There's a seat waiting for you at a table you haven't even seen yet.
- [ ] Oh, to wake up grateful for the pulse in my neck; to meet the mirror without dread.
- [ ] I'm as high as your hopes 
- [ ] The cost of community is inconvenience
- [ ] Everyone wants to be a DJ. No one wants to dance.
I need to be enough—for myself.
