# Habit 2 contd

- [ ] Write a personal mission statement and integrate it into your daily life.
- [ ] Effective people don’t just thoughtlessly pursue things like money and fame; they focus on what’s important to them. Everything else is a waste.
- [ ] Now ask yourself what you’d like them to say. What sort of person do you want to be remembered as? For what do you want to be remembered?
- [ ] then use your answers as a basis for writing a personal mission statement. This is a document where you define your own creed, meaning what kind of person you want to be, what you hope to achieve in your life, as well as the basic values and principles underlying these goals.
