# Impressors 15

- [ ] Kind of want to distribute 1984 at a busy street
- [ ] criticism of any art or media is treated as an assault on the people who like that art and media
- [ ] Your skin makes me feel forgiven
- [ ] If you like this, then you like me.
- [ ] Hello? Do I have to do all the work?
- [ ] If you were a bullet, I'd shoot myself to have you in me.
- [ ] You make overthinking look cute
- [ ] Do you not know your line?
- [ ] Never buy weed from a cat
- [ ] I’m learning to stop shrinking myself to fit spaces that were never meant to hold me.
- [ ] Pyari lagne k alawa aur kya karti hain aap?
- [ ] I don’t wanna read that you’re going to put on some lo-fi jazz to read Sally Rooney with a 40$ scented candle lit up next to your urban outfitter clean sheets.
- [ ] when we said ‘Let’s get off our phones and delete Instagram’ it wasn’t to post an insipid newsletter with details you should only share with your therapist.
- [ ] and I whistle slow walkers on the street because I’m a fearless menace
- [ ] where great minds come to read and write, but also less than spectacular minds have come to this place
- [ ] I watch people who have a great tolerance for suffering as they toil away in lives they despise and I think, thank fuck I’m ‘weak’.
- [ ] I have an intolerance for a life that doesn’t sparkle.
- [ ] Hamish, your last name is McKenzie. one of my best friend’s name is Mackenzie. we have a lot in common, you and I.
- [ ] let’s not pretend you didn’t get your sylvia plath recommendations from the internet as well.
- [ ] we’re evolved monkeys living in a spinning rock in a corner of the universe, it’s really not that deep.
- [ ] Makes me want to slap them backhanded
- [ ] This was a pilgrimage for my earnestly francophile friends
- [ ] The shared fate of those who fuck a lot.
- [ ] The way their hands move toward my skin like they're approaching something sacred.
- [ ] Each kiss a question your body answers without words.
- [ ] And I worked 50 hours this week and the 200 dollars that was left on my bank account after I paid all my bills was used for my entertainment on your shitty fucking book, and If I am your profit, you will not silence my scathing review if I feel like my time and money was wasted to spare you from feeling sad.
- [ ] Hope is optimism with a broken heart
- [ ] Watch any self-proclaimed alpha in the wild and you’ll see it—tight pants, bicep-hugging shirts, veins throbbing, and mouth constantly moving.
- [ ] Your eyes close at the front and open at the back.”
