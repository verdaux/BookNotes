# Impressors 15

- [ ] Kind of want to distribute 1984 at a busy street
- [ ] criticism of any art or media is treated as an assault on the people who like that art and media
- [ ] Your skin makes me feel forgiven
- [ ] If you like this, then you like me.
- [ ] Hello? Do I have to do all the work?
- [ ] If you were a bullet, I'd shoot myself to have you in me.
- [ ] You make overthinking look cute
- [ ] Do you not know your line?
- [ ] Never buy weed from a cat
- [ ] I’m learning to stop shrinking myself to fit spaces that were never meant to hold me.
- [ ] Pyari lagne k alawa aur kya karti hain aap?
- [ ] I don’t wanna read that you’re going to put on some lo-fi jazz to read Sally Rooney with a 40$ scented candle lit up next to your urban outfitter clean sheets.
- [ ] when we said ‘Let’s get off our phones and delete Instagram’ it wasn’t to post an insipid newsletter with details you should only share with your therapist.
- [ ] and I whistle slow walkers on the street because I’m a fearless menace
- [ ] where great minds come to read and write, but also less than spectacular minds have come to this place
- [ ] I watch people who have a great tolerance for suffering as they toil away in lives they despise and I think, thank fuck I’m ‘weak’.
