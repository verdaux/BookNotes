- [ ] I am a story I tell people.
- [ ] Mothefucker's so cool, when he goes to sleep the sheep count him.
- [ ] I've already lost touch with couple of people I used to be.
- [ ] Sawing the very Branch that you are sitting on.
- [ ] A poem written with rose petals. Making the sun blush.
- [ ] I watched sadhguru before he was a javed-fighting viral sensation.
- [ ] Militate against the peace of all life.
- [ ] You are The setting sun. The coming night. The last word in their story.
- [ ] If there's a place further from me, I beg you do not go.
