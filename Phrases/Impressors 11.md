# Impressors 11

- [ ] It's not for public entertainment. But it's good-time adjacent.
- [ ] Both things I famously suck at.
- [ ] How far do you have to reach out for that memory? Last night?
- [ ] Hate the statistics, not the statistician.
- [ ] I love making fun of billionaires
- [ ] I'm fine, as in, "you don't have to worry about me." Fine.
- [ ] I can always find something else to love. I can't find another me.
- [ ] Walked to the mirror. Looked like a killer.
- [ ] Bamboo hum le aur ganna yeh chabaye.
- [ ] You're a sadist. You're pummeling an opponent who isn't fighting back.
