# Impressors 13

- [ ] Life is too short to be in love with everyone you meet.
- [ ] When I raise my eyes to your face, then a fire breaks out and I see nothing but fire.
- [ ] Another reason why a self-respecting man should ever wear torn jeans.
- [ ] I'm a once-in-a-generation writer. The writer to end all writers, you know?
- [ ] Can't disrespect kings and queens like that. Thinking of them ever since
