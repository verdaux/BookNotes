# Java variables 2

- [ ] Java is pass by value meaning pass by copy
- [ ] When you assign 7 to int variable x, the bit pattern for 7 goes into x
- [ ] Instance variables always get a default value. No initialisation needed
- [ ] Instance variables are declared inside a class and OUTSIDE a method
- [ ] Local variables are declared within a method
- [ ] Local variables must be initialised before use.
- [ ] Method parameters are virtually the same as local variables
