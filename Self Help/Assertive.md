# Assertive

- [ ] You go ... With your eyes. And I interpret that to mean you are not with us in some way.
- [ ] Have you noticed how you....?
- [ ] If they deny their behaviour: Say " I may be wrong but Is it okay to point out this behaviour the next time you repeat it?"
- [ ] I don't like it when you do....
- [ ] I'm gonna come back when you're in a calmer mood
- [ ] You are shouting at me. Are you sure this is the best way to resolve this problem?
- [ ] You are correct that this situation could've been handled better. But, calling it stupid is too harsh.
- [ ] I'm really bad at coping with being interrupted.
- [ ] I am not going to justify why I feel a certain way.
- [ ] I am an okay person.
