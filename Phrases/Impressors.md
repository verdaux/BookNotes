# Impressors

- [ ] This looks like a hostage situation. Blink if you are in trouble.
- [ ] Posses not one jot of talent.
- [ ] Let's explore the stars
- [ ] Mysteries of the skin
- [ ] A face difficult to turn away from, a face to dream about
- [ ] Turn your tongue into a weapon of cruelty
- [ ] Indispensable other that dwelled in my skin
- [ ] Each one an inseparable half of a single, two-part human organism
- [ ] A chance to spend a few moments in the ephemeral kingdom of earthly grace.
- [ ] Missed a thing in the way a smoker misses cigarettes
- [ ] The best thing about being 21 is that you don't have to be 21 for more than a year.
- [ ] A man who had suffered and could still crack jokes.
- [ ] There's a violent curse against each and every one who has done me wrong
