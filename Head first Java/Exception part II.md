# Exception part II

- [ ] The compiler checks for everything except RuntimeExceptions
- [ ] If you throw an exception you must declare using throws in method declaration
- [ ] If you call a method that declares throws, one way to satisfy the compiler is to wrap the call in try/catch
- [ ] Exceptions that are not subclasses of RuntimeException are checked for by the compiler. So they're called checked exceptions
