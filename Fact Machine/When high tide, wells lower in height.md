# When high tide, wells lower in height

- [ ] Tides are a distortion in the shape of the earth
- [ ] This is caused by the pull of the moon
- [ ] The pull is stronger on parts of the earth closer to the moon
- [ ] Imagine the ocean immediately beneath the moon
- [ ] The pull on the water on the surface is greater than that on the seabed
