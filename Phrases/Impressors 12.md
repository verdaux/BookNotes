# Impressors 12

- [ ] I'm a boiling cauldron of repressed rage.
- [ ] You are almost making this work. All you gotta do now is change reality.
- [ ] Maybe You don't have to hate the universe for dumping a giant turd on you.
- [ ] You've got the life expectancy of a pretty good sitcom.
- [ ] Fatalism is your survival mechanism.
- [ ] Studied her longer than it was prudent.
- [ ] A writer with limited capabilities
- [ ] A broken record. A liar. I don’t give myself many wins, which is why I need compliments so much. (The only thing I’m an expert at is myself.)
