- [ ] walking through town with a latte, a dream and the nervous system of a frightened prey animal
- [ ] I just realised you are the most interesting thing on my screen today
- [ ] You Popped in my head. I blame you
- [ ] Desire is involuntary, metabolic, the thing that happens despite your better judgment, sometimes even despite your consent.
- [ ] Real thirst is feral and unpredictable.
