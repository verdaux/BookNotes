# Impressors 4

- [ ] There's no ounce of excitement or whisper of a thrill.
- [ ] I want you to levitate
- [ ] Social media turned us into heat seeking missiles
- [ ] You seem like a person with great taste. Should I go with fajitas or scampi tonight? My dinner depends on this. I'd be kicking myself if I didn't try. Have a good one.
- [ ] I'm not like other guys (I'm worse)
- [ ] adults are just children who owe money
- [ ] Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy shit we don’t need.
- [ ] Man 1: Aren’t we supposed to be with our loved ones when we die?
- [ ] Whenever I’m caught between two evils, I take the one I’ve never tried.
- [ ] If the heart could think it would stop beating.
- [ ] George Orwell said that if liberty means anything, it means the right to tell people what they don’t want to hear.
- [ ] If bullshit were poetry, you’d be Shakespeare.
- [ ] I can practically hear you getting fatter
- [ ] It’s not a lie; it’s a gift for ﬁction.
- [ ] Like coaxing a feral cat that will one day sit on you
- [ ] My heart has chosen you. And I follow my heart.
Man 2: No, that’s what life is for.
—The Lift (2000)
