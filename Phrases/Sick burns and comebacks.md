# Sick burns and comebacks

- [ ] If I wanted to hear from an asshole, I'd fart
- [ ] I hope you go far, and stay there
- [ ] If you were any less intelligent we'd have to water you thrice a week
- [ ] I'm jealous of people that don't know you
- [ ] It's kinda sad watching you attempt to fit your entire vocabulary into a sentence.
- [ ] This person is under a mistaken belief that he is funny
