# Impressors 19

- [ ] not hearing from you is suffocation. i would crawl 3,000 miles on broken glass to touch you right now.
- [ ] walking through town with a latte, a dream and the nervous system of a frightened prey animal
- [ ] I just realised you are the most interesting thing on my screen today
- [ ] You Popped in my head. I blame you
- [ ] Desire is involuntary, metabolic, the thing that happens despite your better judgment, sometimes even despite your consent.
- [ ] Real thirst is feral and unpredictable.
- [ ] I procrastinate at an Olympic level.
- [ ] There are very few people who can handle that in an attractive way
- [ ] We're down the rabbit hole and I'm afraid we're never coming back.
- [ ] Quite possibly my 4 favourite words in the English language.
- [ ] I’ll have to check with the officials - but that feels worthy of a drink
- [ ] I look forward to the day where you are as wise as you are aggressive. Until then it's better to protect yourself from further embarrassment by saying nothing.
- [ ] You're not gonna say anything that I've not said 6 inches away from the mirror
