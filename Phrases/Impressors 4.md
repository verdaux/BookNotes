# Impressors 4

- [ ] There's no ounce of excitement or whisper of a thrill.
- [ ] I want you to levitate
- [ ] Social media turned us into heat seeking missiles
- [ ] You seem like a person with great taste. Should I go with fajitas or scampi tonight? My dinner depends on this. I'd be kicking myself if I didn't try. Have a good one.
- [ ] I'm not like other guys (I'm worse)
- [ ] adults are just children who owe money
- [ ] Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy shit we don’t need.
- [ ] Man 1: Aren’t we supposed to be with our loved ones when we die?
- [ ] Whenever I’m caught between two evils, I take the one I’ve never tried.
- [ ] If the heart could think it would stop beating.
Man 2: No, that’s what life is for.
—The Lift (2000)
