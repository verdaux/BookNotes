# Impressors 8

- [ ] The unstoppable marching of time that's slowly leading us to an inevitable death.
- [ ] As a teenager, your feelings are bigger than your body.
- [ ] Music makes you slip in and out of identities.
- [ ] What's a memory from your past that still makes you feel good.
- [ ] I dislike walking in the rain but I'm also strongly against taking out my umbrella from my backpack.
- [ ] I will always adore the part of me that wants what doesn't want me.
