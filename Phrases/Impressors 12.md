- [ ] Fatalism is your survival mechanism.
- [ ] Studied her longer than it was prudent.
- [ ] A writer with limited capabilities
- [ ] A broken record. A liar. I don’t give myself many wins, which is why I need compliments so much. (The only thing I’m an expert at is myself.)
- [ ] This is excessive. Just get Ozempic
- [ ] Money is nice but I'd rather have time.
- [ ] I'm not an alcoholic. I know the whole label thing is so limiting.
- [ ] I try to be chill but my brain writes essays about everything.
- [ ] Waking up from a nap I didn't know I was talking.
