# habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood.

- [ ] We don’t really listen to what they have to say and instead project our own situation onto them, coming up with quick solutions that we can "prescribe" to them.
- [ ] So if you want to be respected as a listener and an imparter of advice, you need to develop the skill of empathic listening.
- [ ] Empathic listening means trying to get inside the other person’s frame of reference so you can understand them both intellectually and emotionally.
- [ ] you shouldn’t just listen to the words; you should attend to the feeling, behavior and meaning behind them.
- [ ] One way to work on your empathic listening skills is to observe a conversation without hearing the words.
