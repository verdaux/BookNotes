# habit 4: Think “win-win.”

- [ ] The major disadvantage of the "win-lose" mentality is that when two people of this mentality come up against each other, the situation usually becomes a "lose-lose" one.
- [ ] So it’s necessary to keep negotiating and communicating until a solution is found that suits all parties.
- [ ] put yourself in the shoes of the other party and write down what you believe would constitute wins for him.
- [ ] always keep promises, be explicit about what you expect of the other person and be courteous and sensitive even in small matters.
